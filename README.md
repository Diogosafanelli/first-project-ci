  - Use of short texts and longer texts, so the reading doesn't get too tiring.
  - Use technologies and tools that improve site development and performance.

### Structure

- For the Safanelli Photographer website I planned to separate the site into five pages.
  - The home page, which will be the site's introduction page, will contain a little about me, who I am, how I started my career and what I expect from my clients
  - The second page (About me) will be about my self .
  - The third page talks about the investment itself, how it works and the values.
  - The fourth page shows my portfolio so my clients can see about my job so far.
  - The last page is made for the customer to be able to contact me, it has a short form which will make the interaction between the service provider and the customer easier.


### Surface

#### Colour scheme

- The colors chosen for the composition of the site were a combination of 6 colors (white, black bean, Antique white, Caput mortuum, Light orange, Ecru).
- To highlight the header and footer I used two shades of Caput mortuum.
- Here is an image of the color palette used on the website (source: Coolors.io).
