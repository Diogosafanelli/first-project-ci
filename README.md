- The website will talk about the investment values and a little about the photographer himself.
- The website goal is to attract people's to look at themselves with a more affectionate look and decide to freeze some moments.
- The website should be simple to navigate and easy to read.

#### User stories

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website, so I can know if it's of interest to me.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site, so I don't lose enthusiasm for using the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to learn something new, so I fulfill the objective that brought me to the site.

- As a user, I want to see media (photos) related to the main subject, so I can better understand what was explained.

### Scope

- For the Safanelli Photographer website I have planned the following features.
  - Use images and text for more varied content.
  - Use of short texts and longer texts, so the reading doesn't get too tiring.
  - Use technologies and tools that improve site development and performance.

### Structure

- For the Safanelli Photographer website I planned to separate the site into five pages.
  - The home page, which will be the site's introduction page, will contain a little about me, who I am, how I started my career and what I expect from my clients
  - The second page (About me) will be about my self .
  - The third page talks about the investment itself, how it works and the values.
  - The fourth page shows my portfolio so my clients can see about my job so far.
  - The last page is made for the customer to be able to contact me, it has a short form which will make the interaction between the service provider and the customer easier.


### Surface

#### Colour scheme

- The colors chosen for the composition of the site were a combination of 6 colors (white, black bean, Antique white, Caput mortuum, Light orange, Ecru).
- To highlight the header and footer I used two shades of Caput mortuum.
- Here is an image of the color palette used on the website (source: Coolors.io).

#### Typography

- The font were selected from Google Fonts.
  - The font chosen was Roboto 

#### Imagery

- The images selected for the website are intended to complement and assist the content. Each image selected was designed to match the section it was added to.
  - About section image: to create an initial visual impact.
  - All images contained in the portfolio page are my own, photographed and edited by myself.
  - The image on the homepage (Home) is also my own, the image which was photographed in the  wicklow mountains, the model that appears is called Thais Oliveira Safanelli.
